## Story
- The story is about a small family living in a small house in Bengaluru. The story starts with the protagonist sitting in a cafe. He's quite fond of the cafe owner Vincent and thinks of him as an all-knowing person who just knows everything without being told anything
- We later deep dive into the family background where they used to be poor and their father was the only working person. The family consisted of father, mother, the protagonist, his sister and one guy named Chikkapa. Only father worked and he was a salesman at a company
- The story then goes into how Appa lost his job and then Chikkapa and Appa start a business of their own
- Appa owns half stake in the company but the whole family does nothing else, everything in the company is managed by Chikkapa only. The narrator has a managerial position in the company but he does literally nothing
- The story dives deep into their struggles and their rise from rags to riches and how drastically it changed the family dynamics. Everyone worked to please Chikkapa, even in his immoral actions. The sister Malati also turned out pretty spoilt
- The title of the story came from Anita and her brother's childhood
- The narrator's marriage to Anita was pretty much based on lies - the family hid their wealth and pretended to be modest so they could get a simple girl who would be easier to manage
- Anita has a tough time adjusting to the family and their messed up dynamics. The family keeps her at a distance and treats her like an outsider who doesn't belong
- The narrator is useless throughout, he can't stand up for Anita against his mother and sister, and just stays passive
- Chikkapa's business dealings are pretty shady, but the family doesn't care as long as the money keeps coming
- There's this disturbing incident where a woman comes looking for Chikkapa and Malati and Amma literally attack her physically. What happened to her afterward remains unclear
- Anita gets pregnant but she doesn't seem happy about it at all
- The story keeps coming back to the cafe where the narrator goes regularly, probably to escape his mess of a home life
- The ending is deliberately vague. There are hints that something dark might have happened (possibly involving Anita), but nothing is spelled out clearly. The narrator remains unreliable till the end

## Impressions
- The story didn't intrigue me much. I was rather displeased with the nature of the protagonist, especially his dependence on others and complete lack of spine
- The instances of Malati and Amma pouncing on the lady who came to their house to meet Chikkapa was a pretty sad state of affairs. Unfortunately most families and family dynamics are like that only - you protect your own even when they're wrong
- I was particularly taken aback by the lies told by the family to get the narrator married to Anita
- The whole "ghachar ghochar" metaphor really fits - everything gets tangled and messed up with money
- The narrator's cowardice is frustrating but it's realistic too. He's basically complicit through his silence
- The book does a good job showing how sudden wealth corrupts families and destroys their values
- Anita's perspective as an outsider makes her situation even more tragic
- The ambiguous ending is unsettling and leaves you with uncomfortable questions about family loyalty and whether staying silent makes you guilty too
